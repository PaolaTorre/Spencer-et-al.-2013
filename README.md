The Encapsulation of Cell-free Transcription and Translation Machinery in Vesicles for the Construction of Cellular Mimics | Protocol
A simple protocol for the preparation of vesicles encapsulating transcription and translation machinery (PURE SYSTEM) 
and the monitoring of protein production inside the vesicles. 
The resulting cell-free systems can be used as a starting point from which to build increasingly complex cellular mimics.
